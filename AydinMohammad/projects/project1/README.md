The company working on a bonus program for loyal customers. Based on the results of this question the company would reward customers with highest rating and work more on advertising for customers who show less interest

Its very important for the company to specify the top 10 movies so they would suggest it for new customers , keep it on the top of the list and show them in advertisements

Rating would be not accurate in case of few ratings. our aim is to find top rated movies with specific number of views . That way they can make statistics about what movies made more profit.
