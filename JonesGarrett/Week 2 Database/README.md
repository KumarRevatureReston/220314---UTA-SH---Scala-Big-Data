# ACID Properties

 1. Atomicity - Each transaction is "all or nothing".  It should always complete fully.  
 2. Consistency - Data should be valid according to all defined rules.  
 3. Isolation - Transactions do not affect each other.  
 4. Durability - Committed data would not be lost even after power failure.
