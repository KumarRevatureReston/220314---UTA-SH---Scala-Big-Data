## Q&A

**Jessica H.**
Where is the link for the QC document?

**Holden**
Cheating and plagarism

There are some things you can't do any other way
Don't copy and paste a significant amount of code (multiple methods)
Tweaking it to make it your own is ok

**Brandon**
QC tomorrow in relation to the project, when we present the project will it be conducted like last week's QC

More so just a presentation
Making sure we met the specs in a project


**Brandon**
Our presentation will be demonstrated in front of everyone?

Yes
Time limit is 5-7 minutes
QC will cut you off if you go overtime

**Alex**
Plagarism, looks at documentation, getting started, use it as scaffolding, use the best practices
Existing scaffolding?

Hard to say without seeing what we are doing
Shy away from copying and pasting something beyond a method or two
He doesn't know if it is a good idea to use scaffolding
Be cautious about how much we're including

Consequences - It depends on the situation
