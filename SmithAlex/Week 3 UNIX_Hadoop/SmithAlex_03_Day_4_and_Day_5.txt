This is a helpful resource, but extremely similar to what I've already done.
If it's strictly necessary for me to run these commands to show that I can run commands I can do that,
but I'm already very experienced with shell interfaces and just showed that skill in the previous assignment.

1) Command for Uploading a file in HDFS
Hadoop fs –put

This command is used to upload a file from the local file system to HDFS. Multiple files can be uploaded using this command by separating the filenames with a space.

2) Command for Downloading a file in HDFS
Hadoop fs –get

This command is used to download a file from the local file system to HDFS. Multiple files can be downloaded using this command by separating the filenames with a space.

3) Command for Viewing the Contents of a file
Hadoop fs –cat

4) Command for Moving Files from Source to Destination
Hadoop fs –mv

5) Command for Removing a Directory or File in HDFS
Hadoop fs –rm

Note- To remove a directory, the directory should be empty before using the rm command.

6) Command for Copying files from local file system to HDFS
Hadoop fs –copyFromLocal 

7) Command to display the length of a file
Hadoop fs –du

8) Command to view the content of a directory
Hadoop fs –ls

9) Command to create a Directory in HDFS
Hadoop fs –mkdir

10) Command to display the first few lines of a file
Hadoop fs –head 


1. Create a directory in HDFS at given path(s).
Usage: hadoop fs -mkdir <paths>
Example: hadoop fs -mkdir /user/kumar/dir1 /user/kumar/dir2


2.  List the contents of a directory.
Usage : hadoop fs -ls <args>
Example: hadoop fs -ls /user/kumar



3. Upload and download a file in HDFS.
Upload: hadoop fs -put:
Copy single src file, or multiple src files from local file system to the Hadoop data file system

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -put <localsrc> ... <HDFS_dest_Path>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -put /home/saurzcode/Samplefile.txt  /user/saurzcode/dir3/

Download:

hadoop fs -get:

Copies/Downloads files to the local file system

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -get <hdfs_src> <localdst>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -get /user/saurzcode/dir3/Samplefile.txt /home/


4. See contents of a file
Same as unix cat command:

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -cat <path[filename]>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -cat /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt


5. Copy a file from source to destination
This command allows multiple sources as well in which case the destination must be a directory.

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -cp <source> <dest>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -cp /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt /user/saurzcode/dir2


6. Copy a file from/To Local file system to HDFS
copyFromLocal

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <localsrc> URI
3Example:
4hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/saurzcode/abc.txt  /user/saurzcode/abc.txt
Similar to put command, except that the source is restricted to a local file reference.

copyToLocal

1Usage:
2hadoop fs -copyToLocal [-ignorecrc] [-crc] URI <localdst>

Similar to get command, except that the destination is restricted to a local file reference.

7. Move file from source to destination.
Note:- Moving files across filesystem is not permitted.

1Usage :
2hadoop fs -mv <src> <dest>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -mv /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt /user/saurzcode/dir2

8. Remove a file or directory in HDFS.
Remove files specified as argument. Deletes directory only when it is empty

1 Usage :
2hadoop fs -rm <arg>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -rm /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
Recursive version of delete.

1Usage :
2hadoop fs -rmr <arg>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -rmr /user/saurzcode/


9. Display last few lines of a file.
Similar to tail command in Unix.

1Usage :
2hadoop fs -tail <path[filename]>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -tail /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt


10. Display the aggregate length of a file.
1Usage :
2hadoop fs -du <path>
3Example:
4hadoop fs -du /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
Please comment which of these commands you found most useful while dealing with Hadoop /HDFS.
