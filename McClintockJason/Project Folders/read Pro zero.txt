Created a working table in PostgreSQL containing information with the best selling video games between 1990 Jan 01 and 2010 Jan 01,
that has a few errors that need to be updated with the following commands;

 1)
// set num_sales to 26662500
update game_stats
set num_sales = 26662500
where game_rank = 15;

2)
// correct spelling error and set to Super Mario Bros
update game_stats
set game_name = 'Super Mario Bros'
where game_rank = 3;

3)
//correct release date to 2008 from 2080
update game_stats
set release_date = '2008-04-10'
where game_rank = 7;

After updating the table it can be seen that there are two games that need to be removed that do not fit the criteria of the table,
as their release date is after the specified cut off for the table.
